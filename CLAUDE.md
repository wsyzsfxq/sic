# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

SIC! (Simple Image Converter) is a Windows Forms desktop application (.NET 10.0, x64-only) by Oire Software. It converts images between formats (JPG, PNG, WEBP, ICO, BMP, TIFF, GIF, AVIF) with optional resizing, using Magick.NET as the image processing backend. HEIC/HEIF (iPhone photos) is supported as an **input** format only — the bundled Magick.NET build can decode HEIC but not encode it (no HEVC/x265 encoder), so HEIC is never offered as a conversion target (issue #30). The app has both a GUI mode and a headless CLI mode.

It uses structured logging (Serilog), file-based configuration (SharpConfig), and gettext-based localization (GetText.NET). Versioning is handled automatically via GitVersion (GitVersion.MsBuild) from git history.

## Build Commands

```bash
dotnet build              # Build the solution (Debug|x64 by default)
dotnet build -c Release   # Release build
dotnet publish -c Release # Publish as single-file executable
```

There are no test projects or linting commands configured yet.

### Localization scripts

Translation scripts live in `src/Sic/locale/scripts/`. Run them with PowerShell:

```bash
# Compile .po files to .mo (required after editing translations)
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File src/Sic/locale/scripts/compile-translations.ps1

# Extract new translatable strings from source into messages.pot
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File src/Sic/locale/scripts/Extract-Strings.ps1

# Merge new strings into existing .po files (preserves existing translations)
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File src/Sic/locale/scripts/Update-Translations.ps1
```

After editing `.po` files, always run `compile-translations.ps1` to regenerate the `.mo` binaries.

**Form titles must be set in the constructor.** `GetText.Extractor` only recognizes *qualified* assignments in the designer (`okButton.Text = "&OK"`); a form's own bare `Text = "Add Folder";` is invisible to it, so the title never reaches the catalog and always renders in English. Every dialog therefore sets its own title right after `Localizer.Localize(this, Localization.Catalog)`:

```csharp
InitializeComponent();
Localizer.Localize(this, Localization.Catalog);
Text = _("Add Folder");
```

Keep the designer's English `Text` as-is — it's what the visual designer shows and the constructor simply reassigns it at runtime. `MainWindow` is the exception: its title is the product name and stays untranslated.

Note that `Update-Translations.ps1` fuzzy-matches new titles against the similarly worded menu items, so freshly merged title entries arrive with `&` mnemonics and trailing `...` and a `#, fuzzy` flag. Fix the `msgstr` and drop the flag — window titles carry neither.

**Languages ship as three parallel pieces**, and a new one is only half-added if any is missing: `locale/<code>/Sic.po` + `.mo` (UI strings), `help/<code>/manual.html` (user manual, resolved by culture name then two-letter code, falling back to `en`), and `installer/Languages/Custom.<code>.isl` wired into the `[Languages]` section of `installer/sic.iss`. Add the code to `SatelliteResourceLanguages` in the csproj as well, or NuGet dependencies (NetSparkle's update UI) stay untranslated. The Settings language dropdown needs no code change — it lists every `locale/` subdirectory that holds a `Sic.mo`, named by the culture's native name.

Hebrew is right-to-left; see `Utils/TextDirection.cs` and `Utils/DialogHelper.cs` below.

## Architecture

**Entry point:** `src/Sic/Program.cs` — Sets up Serilog logging. If CLI arguments are present, runs headless conversion via `System.CommandLine`; otherwise loads config and launches the WinForms `MainWindow`.

### Core modules

**`src/Sic/Models/ImageItem.cs`** — Data model for an image in the conversion queue. Properties: `FilePath`, `ImageData` (for clipboard/URL sources), `OriginalFormat`, `FileName`, `Width`, `Height`, `FileSize`. Display helpers for dimensions and human-readable file sizes.

**`src/Sic/Models/SizeFitProposal.cs`** — Plain data record describing one viable "fit to file size" result (issue #24): target `Format`, output `Width`/`Height`, `Quality` (null for lossless), resulting `FileSize`, a `Resized` flag, and a `Recommended` flag set by ranking. Produced by `ImageConverter.FindSizeFitProposals` and consumed by `ConvertToProposal`. (It lives in `Models`, not `Services`, because it's data, not behavior.)

**`src/Sic/Services/ImageConverter.cs`** — Static conversion engine wrapping Magick.NET. Key methods:
- `LoadFromFile`, `LoadFromStream`, `LoadFromBytes`, `LoadFromUrl` — create `ImageItem` from various sources
- `Convert` — converts an `ImageItem` to a target format with optional resize, writes to disk
- `GeneratePreview` — produces a `Bitmap` for the preview panel
- `GenerateOutputPath`, `GetConflictRenamePath` — output path logic with conflict resolution
- `GetSupportedFormats` — all SIC! format keys in canonical order; `GetEnabledFormats(enabledKeys)` filters them to the user-selected subset (issue #47), preserving order and never returning an empty list
- `FindSizeFitProposals(item, formats, maxBytes, maxWidth, progress)` / `ConvertToProposal(item, proposal, outputPath)` — "fit to file size" (issue #24). Trial encodes go to a `MemoryStream`, never to disk, and every advertised size is a real measurement at the dimensions and quality that will actually be written, so `ConvertToProposal` reproduces a chosen proposal byte-for-byte. Each format is tried two ways: **keep quality, shrink** (`FitAtQuality` — proportions always kept, optional `maxWidth` applied first, never below `MinFitDimension` = 16 px on the smaller side) and, for lossy formats (`JPG`/`WEBP`/`AVIF`, the `LossyFormats` set) that had to give up pixels, **keep every pixel, drop quality** (`FitFullSizeByQuality`, never below `MinFitQuality` = 45). Ranking is **resolution first, then quality, then size** — a full-resolution result at quality 88 beats a downscaled one at 95, which is what someone facing an upload limit actually wants; `ranked[0]` gets `Recommended`. An impossible budget yields an empty list rather than a garbage thumbnail. `progress` (an `IProgress<string>`) is told each format key as its turn starts, which is what drives the determinate progress bar.
  - Both searches **extrapolate rather than bisect**: encoded size tracks pixel count closely, so one cheap `ReferenceProbeLongSide` (384 px) probe yields a bytes-per-pixel estimate that aims every probe after it (`MaxFitProbes` = 8 bounds the worst case). Convergence is tested in output pixels, not in scale — a scale-based test stops far too early on formats whose size tracks pixel count exactly, and silently returns a thumbnail where a usable size existed.
  - The quality search never brute-forces full-resolution encodes (a single full-size AVIF costs ~2 s). It picks a quality on a `QualityProbeLongSide` (768 px) proxy against a pixel-scaled budget, confirms at full size, then **calibrates the proxy from that one real measurement** (`proxyBudget = maxBytes * proxySize / realSize`) and lets the cheap search choose again. `MaxQualityConfirmations` = 2 full-resolution encodes is enough to land on the same quality an exhaustive search finds.
  - Trial encodes are memoized per format in a `(width, height, quality) -> bytes` dictionary shared by both searches; without it the two searches re-encode the same candidates repeatedly.
- `GetSizeFitFormats(formats)` — drops `SizeFitExcludedFormats` (**ICO** and **GIF**) from a format list. Both stay ordinary conversion targets but are never fit-to-size candidates: Magick's ICO encoder hard-throws above **512 px per side** (so probing any normal photo would fail the whole search) and its payload flips between BMP and PNG around 256 px, making encoded size non-monotonic in the scale factor — the exact assumption the binary search relies on; GIF quantizes to ≤256 colors (measured: ~750,000 colors → 76) while ignoring `Quality` entirely, so a badly degraded result would be advertised as "full quality", and it encodes larger than JPG/WEBP at equal dimensions anyway. `FindSizeFitProposals` applies the filter defensively too. Unlike `GetEnabledFormats` this **can** return an empty list (user enabled only ICO/GIF), which `MainWindow` reports with its own message.
- Note: The class name conflicts with `System.Drawing.ImageConverter`; files that use it must import `using ImageConverter = Oire.Sic.Services.ImageConverter;`

**`src/Sic/Services/UnsupportedImageException.cs`** — Domain exception thrown when content downloads/loads fine but isn't a decodable image (e.g. a link to an HTML page). `LoadFromUrl` translates Magick.NET's decode failure into this so the UI can show a friendly "not an image" message without referencing Magick.NET — keeps the image-library dependency inside the Services layer.

### UI

**`src/Sic/MainWindow.cs` + `MainWindow.Designer.cs`** — Main application window. Menu bar (File, Edit, Convert, Help) + `TableLayoutPanel`-based layout with:
- `ListView` (batch queue) + `PictureBox` (image preview) in the top row
- Format dropdown, resize checkbox + resize mode / width / height fields in the controls rows
- Convert Selected + Convert All buttons
- Convert menu also offers *Create Multi-size ICO…* and *Fit to File Size…* (issue #24), each acting on the single selected image. *Fit to File Size* opens `FitToSizeDialog` (max size in KB + optional max width, both plain `TextBox`es like the resize fields), runs `ImageConverter.FindSizeFitProposals` on a background thread behind `ProgressDialog`, then shows `FitToSizeResultsDialog` (a `ListBox` of ranked proposals) and converts the chosen one through the standard output-path + conflict-resolution flow. The search reports each format as it starts, so the progress bar is determinate ("Checking AVIF (6/6)…") rather than a marquee — it can still take tens of seconds on a large photo, and AVIF is by far the slowest. Cancellation lands in about a quarter of a second. The `Progress<string>` callback checks `IsDisposed` first: reports are posted to the UI thread asynchronously, so one queued just before a cancel can arrive after `finally` disposed the dialog.
- `StatusStrip` with status label at the bottom
- Batch operations show a separate `ProgressDialog` with progress bar
- Supports drag & drop, Ctrl+V paste (file drops and bitmap clipboard), Delete key to remove
- Clipboard auto-detection (issue #36, opt-in via `DetectClipboardData`): on `OnShown` and every `Activated`, `CheckClipboardForImport()` offers (Yes/No) to add image data, image files, or an image link from the clipboard. Two gates prevent nagging — the Win32 clipboard sequence number (`GetClipboardSequenceNumber`, P/Invoked) skips unchanged clipboards, and a content signature (hash of image bytes / sorted paths / URL) suppresses re-prompts when the same content is re-copied. The passive detector only offers image-extension URLs; manual Ctrl+V accepts any http(s) link.

**`src/Sic/SettingsDialog.cs` + `SettingsDialog.Designer.cs`** — Settings form. A `TabControl` (filling the form, OK/Cancel beneath) with two tabs, each its own flat `TableLayoutPanel`:
- **General** — language dropdown, confirm-exit checkbox, "check for updates on startup" checkbox, background update-frequency dropdown.
- **Images** — output folder (textbox + browse + reset), a "save converted images in the same folder as the original" checkbox (issue #33), a "detect data in clipboard" checkbox (issue #36), and a target-formats checklist that selects which formats appear in the main window's dropdown (issue #47). Built as individual `CheckBox` controls stacked in a `TableLayoutPanel` (`formatsPanel`, filled at runtime in `PopulateFormats()`) inside a `GroupBox` (`formatsGroupBox`) — *not* a `CheckedListBox`, which doesn't reliably announce toggle state changes to screen readers. The group box caption (rather than a separate label) supplies the accessible group name; each checkbox is its own tab stop. OK requires at least one format ticked; when all are ticked it saves `EnabledFormats` as empty so formats added in future versions show automatically.

Tab page `Text` doesn't honor `&` mnemonics — navigate tabs with Ctrl+Tab / Ctrl+PgUp/Dn. Exposes `UpdatePeriodicCheckChanged` so `MainWindow` can re-arm the background update loop live (without a restart) when the frequency changes.

### Utilities (`src/Sic/Utils/`)

- `Config.cs` — Static config manager using SharpConfig. Reads/writes `%APPDATA%/Oire/Sic/Sic.cfg` with a `[General]` section (Language, OutputFolder, SaveToSourceFolder, LastInputFolder, ConfirmExitWithQueue, CheckForUpdatesOnStartup, UpdateCheckInterval, DetectClipboardData, EnabledFormats). `SaveToSourceFolder` (issue #33), when on, writes converted files next to each original instead of into `OutputFolder`; clipboard/URL items have no source folder and fall back to `OutputFolder`. `EnabledFormats` is a comma-separated list of SIC! format keys shown in the target dropdown (empty = all); parse it via `GetEnabledFormatKeys()` and filter with `ImageConverter.GetEnabledFormats(...)`. Accepts `isGui` parameter to route errors to MessageBox (GUI) or stderr (CLI).
- `FileHelper.cs` — Cloud placeholder detection (OneDrive/SharePoint recall attributes) and image file enumeration with glob patterns.
- `UrlHelper.cs` — Single source of truth for link validation: `IsValidHttpUrl(text, out url)` trims input and checks for an absolute http(s) URL. Used by the "Add by link" dialog, Ctrl+V paste, and clipboard auto-detection so all three validate links identically.
- `Localization.cs` — Wraps GetText.NET with convenience methods: `_()`, `_n()`, `_p()`, `_pn()` for translations. Loads `.mo` files from the `locale/` folder relative to the executable. Falls back through language parents to `en-US`.
- `TextDirection.cs` — Right-to-left support (Hebrew). `Apply(form)` sets `RightToLeft` from the active culture and walks the control tree setting `RightToLeftLayout`, which — unlike `RightToLeft` — is *not* ambient and only exists on `Form`, `ListView`, `TabControl` and `ProgressBar`. Every form calls it immediately after `Localizer.Localize`, and `MainWindow.ApplyLocalization` calls it again so a live language switch re-mirrors the window. The hand-built file-conflict dialog in `MainWindow.ResolveFileConflict` calls it too.
- `DialogHelper.cs` — `Show(text, caption, buttons, icon)`, a one-method wrapper over `MessageBox.Show`. WinForms mirrors a message box only when passed `MessageBoxOptions.RtlReading | RightAlign`, and those cannot be inherited from the owning form, so **every** message box in SIC! goes through here — never call `MessageBox.Show` directly.
- `Constants/App.cs` — Application metadata, data folder paths (`%APPDATA%/Oire/Sic/`), file extensions.
- `Constants/ExitCode.cs` — CLI exit code constants (`Success`, `Error`, `Canceled`).
- `Constants/Logging.cs` — Log file paths and output templates. Logs go to `%APPDATA%/Oire/Sic/logs/`.
- `Enums/UpdateCheckInterval.cs` — Background update-check frequency (`Daily`, `EveryThreeDays`, `Weekly`, `Monthly`, `Never`). The configuration explicitly defaults to `Never` in this fork.

### Key dependencies

| Package | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Magick.NET-Q16-x64 | Image loading, conversion, resizing (16-bit per channel) |
| System.CommandLine | CLI argument parsing |
| Serilog (+File, +Compact) | Structured logging |
| SharpConfig | INI-style config file |
| GetText.NET | Localization |
| GitVersion.MsBuild | Automatic versioning from git |

## CLI Mode

When launched with arguments, the app runs headless (no UI). Format is inferred from the output file extension.

```bash
sic -i input.png -o output.jpg                    # Convert PNG to JPG
sic --input photo.bmp --output photo.webp          # Convert BMP to WebP
sic -i avatar.png -o avatar.ico --resize 128x128   # Convert + resize
```

Options: `--input`/`-i` (required), `--output`/`-o` or `--format`/`-f` (one required), `--resize`/`-r` (optional, WxH/Wx/xH format), `--crop`/`-c` (optional, requires both W and H).

## Product Spec (v1)

SIC! is an accessible image format converter primarily aimed at blind and low-confidence users, but designed to be visually appealing enough for sighted users too.

### Core workflow

1. **Main window** = a list of images (batch queue). Empty on launch.
2. **Adding images** via:
   - Drag & drop files onto the list
   - Ctrl+V paste (both clipboard files like Outlook attachments, and raw bitmap data like PrintScreen screenshots)
   - "Open file" button/dialog
   - Add by link (downloads the image and adds it to the queue)
3. **Pick target format** from a dropdown (JPG, PNG, WEBP, ICO, BMP, TIFF, GIF, AVIF).
4. **Optional resize** — checkbox that reveals width/height fields (critical for blind users who get told "upload a 128x128 photo").
5. **Hit Convert** — processes all items in the list to the chosen format.
6. **Output location** — by default, files are saved next to their source image. Clipboard and URL inputs fall back to `%APPDATA%\Oire\Sic\Converted\` (or `userdata\Converted\` in portable mode).
7. **Filename conflict** — always ask (overwrite / rename to `_1` suffix / skip). Never silently overwrite.

### UI guidelines

- **Use `TableLayoutPanel` throughout** — the developer is blind and needs to adjust layouts without counting pixel coordinates. Use flat layouts (no nesting) with percentage-based column styles where possible.
- **Image preview panel** — sighted users should see a preview of the selected image. This is not a blind-only tool; it should look and feel like a proper app a sighted person would also choose to use.
- **Resize controls** — consider visual resize handles or interactive controls for sighted users in addition to the WxH text fields.
- **Accessibility first** — proper tab order, meaningful labels, keyboard accelerators (underlined letters via `&`) on all interactive controls. Do **not** set `AccessibleName` on controls that already have a meaningful `Text` property — it overrides what screen readers use. Only set `AccessibleName` on controls without descriptive text (e.g., `ListView`).
- **ListView re-entrancy** — WinForms `ListView` raises `SelectedIndexChanged` synchronously from inside its own `WndProc` while items are being removed. **Never mutate `imageListView.Items` (insert, remove, clear) from within `SelectedIndexChanged`, or from any MessageBox pump that runs while the list is in an intermediate state** — this causes internal `NullReferenceException`s in `ListView.WndProc`. `UpdateMenuState()` is safe to call from event handlers (only toggles `Enabled` flags); placeholder row management is split into `UpdatePlaceholderState()` which is only called from the tail of user-initiated add/remove flows.
- **Empty-list placeholder** — when `_imageItems` is empty, a fake `ListViewItem` ("Add your images here") is inserted and marked `Selected`/`Focused` so screen readers announce the empty state. All handlers that index into `_imageItems` via `SelectedIndices` must guard on `_imageItems.Count > 0` so Delete/F5/Ctrl+Alt+F5 are no-ops when only the placeholder is present.
- **WinForms internal NRE safety net** — `Program.cs` installs an `Application.ThreadException` handler that suppresses `NullReferenceException`s whose call site is inside `System.Windows.Forms.*` (notably the `ListView.Unhook` race during `Form.Dispose`, which is a known framework bug). Other UI-thread exceptions are logged and surfaced via a non-fatal MessageBox instead of killing the app.

### Settings (via SharpConfig, stored in `%APPDATA%/Oire/Sic/Sic.cfg`)

- Output folder (default: `Converted` subfolder in the data directory)
- Save converted images in the same folder as the original (`SaveToSourceFolder`, default: on) — each converted file is written next to its source file instead of into the output folder (issue #33). Clipboard captures and downloaded links have no source folder, so they still go to the output folder.
- Language
- Confirm exit when images are in the queue
- Check for updates on startup (default: disabled) — opt-in in this fork
- Background update-check frequency (`UpdateCheckInterval`: Daily / EveryThreeDays / Weekly / Monthly / Never; default Never)
- Detect data in clipboard (`DetectClipboardData`, default: off) — when on, SIC! offers (via a Yes/No prompt) to add usable clipboard content (raw image, image files, or an image link) when the window opens or regains focus. Deduplicated by the Win32 clipboard sequence number so the same payload is offered at most once.
- Target formats to show (`EnabledFormats`, default: empty = all) — comma-separated list of format keys to display in the target-format dropdown, letting users hide formats they never convert to (issue #47). Empty means every supported format; at least one must stay selected.

## Auto-Updates (NetSparkleUpdater)

The app uses [NetSparkleUpdater](https://github.com/NetSparkleUpdater/NetSparkle) with Ed25519 signature verification for automatic updates.

### Key setup

Updates are signed with an Ed25519 key pair. The public key is embedded in `src/Sic/Utils/Constants/App.cs` (`UpdatePublicKey`). The private key is **not** checked into the repo — it lives in a `keys/` directory at the repo root (gitignored).

To generate a new key pair (only needed once, or if forking the project):

```bash
# Install the appcast tool globally
dotnet tool install --global NetSparkleUpdater.Tools.AppCastGenerator

# Generate keys into the keys/ directory
netsparkle-generate-appcast --generate-keys --key-path keys
```

This creates `keys/NetSparkle_Ed25519.priv` and `keys/NetSparkle_Ed25519.pub`. After generating, update the `UpdatePublicKey` constant in `App.cs` with the contents of the `.pub` file, and update `AppcastUrl` if hosting elsewhere.

### Building a release

The `installer/Build-Installer.ps1` script handles the full release pipeline:

```powershell
.\installer\Build-Installer.ps1                        # Build app + installer only
.\installer\Build-Installer.ps1 -Appcast               # Also generate signed appcast
.\installer\Build-Installer.ps1 -Appcast -Deploy       # Build, appcast, and deploy via SCP
.\installer\Build-Installer.ps1 -Appcast -NoPortable   # Skip portable ZIP (e.g., for beta releases)
.\installer\Build-Installer.ps1 -SkipBuild             # Installer only (use existing binaries)
```

The script produces in `installer/Output/`:
- `sic-v{version}-setup.exe` — Inno Setup installer
- `sic-v{version}-portable.zip` — portable archive (unless `-NoPortable`)
- `appcast.xml` and `appcast.xml.signature` (if `-Appcast`)

The portable ZIP is compressed with 7-Zip (ultra settings) if available, otherwise falls back to built-in `Compress-Archive` with a warning.

### Deploying

The `-Deploy` switch uploads release files to the hosting server via SCP. It reads SSH connection details from `installer/deploy.json` (gitignored). Copy `installer/deploy.example.json` to get started:

```json
{
    "SshHost": "your-ssh-host-alias",
    "RemotePath": "/path/to/your/remote/folder/"
}
```

`SshHost` should reference a host alias defined in your SSH config (`~/.ssh/config`).

### Release notes

Per-version changelogs go in a `changelogs/` directory at the repo root (e.g., `changelogs/1.0.0.md`). The appcast generator embeds them in the appcast XML.

### Updating winget manifests

The app is published to winget as `Oire.Sic`. After a new GitHub release, update the manifest with `wingetcreate`. Because the app is x64-only but wingetcreate misdetects Inno Setup installers as x86, you **must** append `|x64` to the URL to override the architecture:

```bash
wingetcreate update -u 'https://github.com/Oire/sic/releases/download/v<VERSION>/sic-v<VERSION>-setup.exe|x64' -v <VERSION> --submit --token "$(gh auth token)" Oire.Sic
```

Without the `|x64` suffix the command fails with a "Multiple matches" error.

## Code Conventions

- **Namespaces:** `Oire.Sic`, `Oire.Sic.Models`, `Oire.Sic.Services`, `Oire.Sic.Utils`, `Oire.Sic.Utils.Constants`
- **Nullable reference types** are enabled; **all warnings are treated as errors** — code must compile cleanly
- **Implicit usings** are enabled (no explicit `using System;` etc.)
- **.NET analyzers** at latest analysis level are enforced
- Debug builds include full symbols and extra telemetry logging; Release builds are optimized with no symbols
- Locale `.mo` files under `locale/` are copied to output via `<None Update>` in the csproj
- The project uses a code formatter/linter — expect same-line opening braces (no newline before `{`, `else`, `catch`, `finally`) in committed code
